Hello! This is a re-implemented version of the classic arcade game, snake, coded in Python. It was made as a project for an experiental learning course where we had to re-develope an open source program. The original code was taken from Grant Jenks' GitHub page:
	
	https://github.com/grantjenks/free_python_games

The orginal code is included. The main() function of the re-implemented code is within 'controller.py'.

**IMPORTANT**
In order for this game to run, both 32-bit python and 32-bit pygame must be installed. They must both be 32-bit! Here are links to the download pages:

	https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/

We used Python 2.7.11

Enjoy!
